UPDATE 1.2.0 IS OUT! MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE 1.2.0 VERSION!

Patch Notes:
• Added FK/IK Button Switches that will instantly switch between FK/IK for the arms/legs/eyes and create a keyframe for it if you are doing a animation, if not you can just delete the keyframes!

• Fixed the Female Legs! Theres now a button that will fix the female legs since it has been glitched for whatever reason (only use the button if the legs are glitched for you some models dont have the glitch i think)

• Changed the look of the addon a bit

Whats next: Rammatra unique rig (once i figure out how to properly seperate his regular and other form), Wrecking Ball Rig (Kinda Hard dont really know how to start it tbh), D.Va Rig (hard as well, dont know where to start with it) rig for the fingers, renaming more bones, (if you have any suggestions please let me know)

# Overwatch-Ik-Rig-Blender-Addon
Generates a ik rig for overwatch models extracted from datatool/datawatch 

To Install, Download the recent zip file (just select it under the readme file and click download), and go in blender and go to edit > preferences > addons > install and install the zip file and enable it.

Once installed it will pop up on the side of the sidebar and to create the ik just select the armature on a character in object mode and press "Create Ik"

This will Create A Ik rig for the selected character.

Bones are renamed to be easier to know what you're selecting, along with changing the look of the bones.

Important Bones for the Ik: Ik_foot_l/r (Moves the legs), Ik_hand_r/l (Moves the entire arms), Pole_arm_r/l (moving this bone will move the direction of elbow), Pole_leg_r/l (moving this bone will move the direction of the knee), eye_follow_r (a bone that the right eye will follow), eye_follow_l (a bone that the left eye will follow) eye_follow, (a bone that both eyes will follow.

Note: This is version 1. i still need to add and update things, below are some bugs and upcoming changes to the addon.

Bugs: 

4. Sometimes the Root bone doesnt scale up, this is due to some root bones being sized differently and when scaled up it just isnt big like its supposed to, to fix you can just go to pose select the root bone at the very bottom, and go to bone properties, and then go to viewport display > custom shape, and then change the scale xyz values to a VERY high number like around 500-700, if thats to big then youc an always scale it to your liking.

Upcoming changes:
1. Adding more singular buttons for each non human character that will make a unique rig for them (hard, prob need help lollll)
2. renaming more bones and changing the look of more of them 
3. Adding a facial rig (probably wont be anytime in the upcoming weeks)
4. Rig for the fingers

Any ideas or suggestions, or feedback are appreciated!
